The 'Blinky' project is a simple program for the STM32F207Z
microcontroller  using STM 'STM3220F-EVAL' Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =           25.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =          120.00 MHz

 - Sys Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - LED blink with speed depending on potentiometer position
 - colour LCD display shows init message and bargraph depending on potentiometer position
 - AD is used with DMA or IRQ (see file Blinky.c)
 - AD settings: 12 bit resolution
 - AD value is output onto serial port UART4 
   UART4 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit
 

The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  STM32F207 Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                    (used for production or target debugging)

  STM32F207 RAM:    runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                    (may be used for target debugging)
