The 'LCD_Blinky' project is a simple program for the STM32F207Z
microcontroller  using STM 'STM3220F-EVAL' Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =           25.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =          120.00 MHz
 - Displays rotating ARM 3D logo, each picture is displayed every 150 ms
 - 4 LEDs blink with speed of 50 ms, determined by SysTick Timer working in interrupt mode
 

The Blinky program is available for target:

  STM32F207 Flash: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                   (used for production or target debugging)


Notes: - In EVAL version of uVision do not rebuild the target as 
         this example's size exceeds EVAL version limitation


Picture conversion procedure:
1. Convert picture to 16 BPP (R - 5bits, G - 6bits, B - 5bits)
2. Remove header from bmp by hex editor, remaining file size should 
   be equal to (width * height * 2) bytes
3. Convert prepared file without header to C array
